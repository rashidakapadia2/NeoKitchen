    <h2>Recipe of the Day!</h2>
    <h3>Polish Kolaczkzi</h3>
<p>
    This Polish kołaczki cookie recipe is made with a cream cheese dough that bakes up buttery and flaky. Kołaczki can be round, square or diamond-shaped, and the dough can be flaky or yeast-risen, and the spelling varies widely.
    
    
    Since they are a little time consuming to make, they are usually offered for holidays or special occasions, but they're not difficult, so most dedicated bakers make them year-round.
    
    
    Fillings of choice include apricot, raspberry, prune, almond, poppy seed, and sweet cheese. Anything goes—strawberry, blueberry, apricot, even pineapple. Try to avoid going with jam as it is typically not thick enough. Look for products labeled cake and pastry filling in the baking aisle at the grocery store. Some stores even sell the filling on its own in their bakery departments around the holidays.
    
    
    You will need to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour before rolling and cutting, so plan accordingly. You can freeze unbaked filled kołaczki, then bake from frozen when you're ready. All you need to do is add a few extra minutes to the baking time.

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> 8 ounces cream cheese (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups salted butter (room temperature)</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar (for rolling out dough)</li>
        <li>Confectioners' sugar (for rolling out dough)</li>
        <li>8 to 10 ounces cake and pastry filling (raspberry, apricot, prune, etc.)</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
       </ul>
        <h5>Steps to make it</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

            <li>Assemble Polish Kołaczki ingedients in a large bowl, beat cream cheese with butter until light and fluffy.</li>
                
            <li>Add the flour  to butter and cream cheese, 1 cup at a time, and mix well.</li>
                
            <li>Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                
            <li>Heat oven to 350 F. Roll out dough to a 12 x 18-inch rectangle—1/4-inch thick—on a silicone mat or a surface that has been dusted with equal parts confectioners' and granulated sugars (not flour), because the granulated sugar will act as ball bearings and help keep the dough from sticking.</li>
                
            <li>Cut into 2-inch squares. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling on center of each square. Brush a tiny bit of beaten egg white on one corner and press the opposite corner on it, pressing the dough together lightly to seal.</li>
                
            <li>Using a spatula, transfer the filled cookies to a parchment-lined sheet pan and bake for 15 minutes (longer if baking from frozen) or until corners start to brown.</li>
                
            <li>Using a spatula, remove cookies from the baking sheet and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before dusting with confectioners’ sugar. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Tips</h5>
        <p>It is recommended that jarred or canned cake and pastry filling—like the Solo brand— be used for this recipe, as any fresh fruit filling will have a tendency to leak out of the cookie when baking.</p>
       

       <h5>Frequently asked Questions</h5>
       <button id="shift">SHOW MORE</button><br><br>

<i>Can I use any other jam?</i><br>
<span class="arc"> Yes, Kolaczki cookies can be filled with other jams of apricot, prunes or other fruit. 
    They can also be filled with cheese, nuts, or poppy seed pastes.</span><br><br>

<i>How do I stop jam in the cookies from running?</i><br>
<span class="arc">To stop the jam from running, just put a teaspoonful of jam in the center of the cookies. 
    Don’t use too much jam as the oven’s heat makes the jam spread out.</span><br><br>

<i>My dough is sticking to the rolling pin. Can I roll it with flour?</i><br>
<span class="arc">Yes, you can use flour to roll the dough. But here’s a trick, use powdered sugar to roll the dough instead of the flour. 
    While the flour would dry the cookies, the powdered sugar helps roll them out without drying or sticking.</span><br><br>

<i>My cookies are still soft? Should I cook them longer?</i><br>
<span class="arc">No, cookies are always soft when they’re just out of the oven. 
    Once they cool down, they will toughen up to the right degree.</span><br><br>

<i>What is ice cream kolaczki?</i><br>
<span class="arc">Ice cream kolaczkis are cookies where the dough is made with ice cream instead of cream cheese. 
    These taste lush too. You can replace the cream cheese in this recipe with about 300 ml of ice cream. The rest of the steps are the same.</span><br><br>

<i>Can You Freeze Kolaczki?</i><br>
<span class="arc">Yes, you can freeze these cookies, which can be helpful for your holiday meal and cookie prep process.
        Make the dough and fill the cookies ahead of time. Freeze on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
        Once they're completely frozen, transfer to a freezer-safe container separated by sheets of parchment paper. Bake them from the frozen state.
        It's not recommended, however, to freeze kołaczki after the cookies have been baked. When defrosted, they become soggy and unpalatable.
        You can also freeze any leftover filling in a zip-close bag or​ another container, with little loss in flavor or consistency. 
        Just defrost when you're ready to use. Pour off any accumulated moisture on the surface, stir, and it should be ready to go.</span><br><br>
       
<i>How to Store Kolaczki?</i><br>
<span class="arc">These cookies tend to become soggy after several days, so store them tightly covered without the confectioners' sugar.
     Dust with confectioners' sugar just prior to serving.</span><br><br>
